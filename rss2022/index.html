                        <p>Recent years have seen significant progress made in standardizing robot software, thanks to ROS and its associated simulation tools such as Gazebo. This has enabled researchers to build on each other’s work without having to reinvent the wheel. Nevertheless, there is a critical lack of infrastructure when it comes to multi-robot systems and collaborative autonomy. <b>The key question that we would like to discuss at this workshop is: what should the testing and validation infrastructure for multi-robot and collaborative autonomy look like. </b></p>

                    <p>Researchers who are inventing and enhancing new collaboration algorithms sometimes resort to testing their innovations on a small set of simplified scenarios that they have used in their previous work in order to reduce the time and cost of testing. Such testing may be merely a demonstration that the collaboration algorithm works; it may not yield comparisons with existing algorithms that generate insights into the performance and cost tradeoffs; and it may not consider a broad enough set of missions and scenarios needed for test and evaluation, validation and verification (TEVV). The multi-robot systems community needs an infrastructure that supports system development and testing from concept to realization in multiple domains. The goal of this workshop is to bring together researchers and practitioners to understand the infrastructure needs of collaborative autonomy testing. </p>

                    <p>The University of Maryland recently received a planning grant from the CISE Community Research Infrastructure (CCRI) program to envision what an Infrastructure for Collaborative Autonomy Testing (ICAT) would look like. Through this workshop, we seek to foster a discussion with the broader community, understand the needs of the stakeholders, and identify effective resources that might be incorporated into ICAT. Through this workshop, a larger portion of the CISE MRS research community will be able to participate in the design of ICAT.</p>

          <p><b>Low-cost maritime fleet planning and operation</b></p>
          <p>Nina Mahmoudian</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		  This talk will present a holistic approach to low-cost fleet planning and operation for a variety of applications such as physical oceanography, Arctic observation, coastal surveillance, and target detection/classification that depend on the persistent operation of unmanned systems in maritime environments. We accomplish this through addressing the fleet planning problem of diverse fleets along with designing, simulating and validating custom and off the shelf Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs), Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), and Underwater Gliders (UGs). In this talk, I will describe recent progress on mission planning considering realistic constraints on performance and degradation, design and operation of a custom small underwater glider ROUGHIE, development, optimization, testing, and validation of a collapsible underwater docking station for a range of AUVS, development and testing of a custom low cost USV, and validation of mission planning maneuvers using off the shelf AUVs. Simultaneous validation of multiple vehicles is achieved through surrogate models such as a fleet of low-cost, compact aerial platforms. This approach enables a lower cost and faster transition of novel persistent fleet technology to the field compared to directly transitioning from simulation to multiple high-cost assets.

          <p><b>On simulating multi-fleet operations with Gazebo and Open-RMF</b></p>
          <p>Morgan Quigley and Michael Grey</p>
	  <p><b>Abstract:</b>
	  In recent years, many applications of mobile robots have become commercially viable. Large buildings in a variety of industries now operate fleets of robots for cleaning, delivery, security patrols, and so on. Some buildings are now starting to operate multiple fleets of robots from multiple vendors, and discovering the challenges inherent in multi-vendor operations. In particular, fleets are often unaware of the other fleets in the facility, and although intra-fleet deconfliction is a common feature, inter-fleet deconfliction is often achieved operationally only through spatial or temporal isolation. Such isolation techniques can work up to a point, but often fail to scale beyond two or three fleets. In this talk, we will present Open-RMF, an open-source multi-fleet deconfliction and operations framework. We will describe our Gazebo-based development and testing process. We will also discuss the challenges of "emulating" the behavior of proprietary fleets, and share some thoughts on how simulation testing could be improved in the future, potentially by using vendor-provided fleet management software "in the loop" to reduce surprises in real-world testing.

          <p><b>Emerging Testing Techniques to Validate Robot Systems</b></p>
          <p>Sebastian Elbaum</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
The soaring number of autonomous systems are bringing to prominence the insidiousness and potential impact of their faults. In turn, these faults highlight the limitations of existing analysis techniques, which are being challenged by robots’ immense and rich
 input space, the integration of cyber and physical semantics, the multiple sources of uncertainty, and the incorporation of machine learning components. In this talk I will provide an overview of some mobile robotic platforms and frameworks that we have targeted
 to ground our research efforts in addressing these challenges, the range of properties that those systems are meant to satisfy from robustness to ethical concerns, and the body of techniques we have developed to address those challenges. I will argue that
 such techniques must be an integral part of any testing infrastructure aiming at validating robots.

          <p><b>Crazyswarm(2): A Testbed for Aerial Robot Teams</b></p>
          <p>Wolfgang Hönig</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
I will present key concepts and use-cases for the Crazyswarm, a ROS-based test-bed for operating large aerial multi-robot teams that use the commercially available Bitcraze Crazyflie as autopilot. A particular focus will be on how we solved challenges around localization, communication, and simulation, which are often an issue for any multi-robot system. I will also provide an overview of the current state of Crazyswarm2, our re-designed, ROS2-based version of the testbed. Finally, I will present examples and my future vision of how Crazyswarm(2) has been and will be useful for testing and validation of autonomous multi-robot teams.

          <p><b>DOTS: An Open Testbed for Industrial Swarm Robotic Solutions</b></p>
          <p>Simon Jones</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
We present DOTS, a new open access testbed for industrial swarm robotics experimentation. It consists of 20+ fast agile robots with high sensing and computational performance, and real-world payload capability. They are housed in an arena equipped with private 5G, motion capture, multiple cameras, and are openly accessible via an online portal.
Our aim is to reduce barriers to entry by providing a complete platform-agnostic pipeline to develop, simulate, and deploy experimental applications to the swarm. As a proof-of-concept, we show how the testbed can be used to design new intralogistics solutions using out-of-the-box swarms.
