                        <p>Multi-robot collaborative systems are an integral part of any large scale operation. Even more the heterogeneity of the team while opening up great opportunities - different viewpoints, traversability constraints, battery life extension, at the same time creates a new dimensionality of difficulty. Increasing interest in using heterogeneous systems has resulted in numerous works in the literature, nevertheless these solutions tend to divide and conquer - divide tasks for each type of robot and solve for a homogenous system. Moreover, we see very few real world demonstrations in academia and the industry of deploying teams of heterogeneous robots.
 </b></p>

                    <p>The main questions we want to address in this workshop are: is it possible to mathematically define heterogeneity of the system, what is the role of learning in such systems, what does heterogeneity bring into the table, what are the successful real world examples of these systems and what we can learn from these case studies. This workshop aims to bring together a group of researchers both from academia and industry to discuss these problems. We want to open a conversation between industry practitioners and researchers to highlight the fundamental issues faced in the heterogeneous multi-robot system design and deployment. </p>

                  <p> We invite participants to submit their research in IEEE Conference format (up to 4 pages including figures, excluding references). We encourage the submission of early ideas, late-breaking results, position papers, or open research questions that are
                    likely to generate interesting discussions. Accepted papers will be presented in a poster session and selected papers as spotlight talks. All submitted contributions will go through a single blind review process.</p>

                  <br><h4>Discussion Topics</h4></br>

<p>The specific goals of the workshop will be to discuss ideas around following topics:
<ul>
<li>What are the theoretical foundations of heterogenous multi-robot systems (HMRS);</li>
<li>What is the state of learning in HMRS;</li>
<li>How can HMRS be deployed in large scale operations;</li>
<li>What is the state of art in academia and in industry.</li>
</ul>
                  </p>

          <p><b>Heterogeneous Robot Teams: Land, Sea, Air, and Underground Operations</b></p>
          <p>Prof. Ronald C. Arkin</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		 At Georgia Tech we have studied robot teaming for over 30 years, starting from multiple robots maintaining behavior-based formations in outdoor settings. We then explored heterogenous air and ground robot teams: from coordinated patrols for situational awareness; to micro autonomous systems in urban environments using conceptual space theory and target discovery and tracking; to broad area maritime surveillance for naval operations; to bio-inspired teams modeled after bird lekking behavior and age-differentiated wolf packs; to multi-robot mission specification and multi-strategy learning; to misdirection/counter-misdirection using robot shills; and most recently underground operations as part of the DARPA Subterranean challenge where we placed second. The evolution of our research moved from teams of similar robots, to heterogeneous teams in differing domains, while recognizing that human-robot teaming is an example of heterogeneous agents while maintaining concern for the societal and ethical implications of this research.  This talk surveys a sample of this broad area of our research ranging from behavior based formations, inter-robot communication management, underground task allocation and HRI between the operator and heterogeneous team among others as time permits.

          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		  Real-world applications with multiple objectives can greatly benefit when multi-robot systems are heterogeneous. In this talk, I will present some of the applications for which we use heterogeneous multi-robot systems. These include dynamic environment monitoring, searching for moving targets and urban reconnaissance. The heterogeneity in the proposed applications is showcased in terms of the robots in different domains as well as robots with different capabilities. I will also highlight some of our efforts on learning-based heterogeneous multi-robot systems, the challenges encountered, and the lessons learned.

          <p><b>The Value of Heterogenous Autonomous Systems in Industry</b></p>
          <p>Dr. Andreas Kolling</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
		  Amazon is a pioneer in robotics and has built the largest worldwide fleet of robots, with more than 750,000 robots in continuous operation. Autonomous systems have become a reality in our facilities around the globe from mobile robots to robot arms. Scientists and engineers continue to work on scaling our systems and adding new types of robots. With that new reality come a host of questions around the purpose of autonomy and how to safely and efficiently design robots that interact with millions of people.

We will showcase the diversity of these systems, what considerations play a role during design, deployment, and maintenance, and how one might think about the capabilities of a hierarchical and heterogenous system of systems.  </p>

          <p><b>Object detection and tracking in Collaborative Multi-Robot settings.</b></p>
          <p>Danilo Petrocelli</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
            Recent technical advancements in both fields of Multi-Robot and Deep Learning Systems have enabled a specific set of applications possible.
      Multi-Robot Systems are inherently capable of providing greater resilience and versatility in a diverse set of tasks when compared to a single robot platform, owing to their ability to collaborate to achieve multiple objectives. On the other hand, Deep Learning systems can robustly detect and track objects of interest in complex scenarios.
      However, one of the main problems in the integration of these two areas is the bottleneck of computing Deep Learning applications on resource-limited platforms of UAVs and USVs.
      To enhance collaborative perception and situational awareness, it is necessary to provide a reliable real-time vision system, capable of operating in a dynamic and complex environment, to deliver useful insights among agents.
      This talk gives an overview on the ongoing R&D projects at Maritime Robotics. We discuss a general framework that can be adopted in a maritime scenario based on the primary constraints of the resource-limited computing platform of UAVs/USVs.

          <p><b>Trust Adaptation for Multi-Agent Safety via Tunable Control Barrier Functions</b></p>
          <p>Dr. Dimitra Panagou</p>
          <p><b>Abstract:</b>
            We will present some of our recent results and ongoing work on safety-critical control
      synthesis under constraints, with applications to heterogeneous multi-agent systems of
      cooperative and non-cooperative agents. The approach introduces the Rate Tunable Control
      Barrier Functions, which adapt online the parameters of the safety certificates (Control Barrier
      Functions) of each agent based on a trust metric/score that each agent builds about its neighbors.
      The proposed framework aims to eventually develop and integrate adaptive, learning and control
      methods towards provably-correct and computationally-efficient mission synthesis for multi-
      agent systems in the presence of constraints and uncertainty.  </p>
          <p><b>Bio:</b>

      Pennsylvania (June 2013, Fall 2010) and a visiting research scholar with the University of
      Delaware, Mechanical Engineering Department (Spring 2009).
      Dr. Panagou’s research program spans the areas of nonlinear systems and control; multi-agent
      systems and networks; motion and path planning; human-robot interaction; navigation, guidance,
      and control of aerospace vehicles. She is particularly interested in the development of provably-
      correct methods for the safe and secure (resilient) operation of autonomous systems in
      complex missions, with applications in robot/sensor networks and multi-vehicle systems
      (ground, marine, aerial, space). Dr. Panagou is a recipient of the NASA Early Career Faculty
      Award, the AFOSR Young Investigator Award, the NSF CAREER Award, and a Senior Member
      of the IEEE and the AIAA.
