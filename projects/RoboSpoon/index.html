            <p>
                Robotic Assisted Feeding (RAF) addresses the
fundamental need for individuals with mobility impairments to
regain autonomy in feeding themselves. The goal of RAF is to
use a robot arm to acquire and transfer food to individuals from
the table. Existing RAF methods primarily focus on solid foods,
leaving a gap in manipulation strategies for semi-solid and
deformable foods. This study introduces Long-horizon Visual
Action (LAVA) based food acquisition of liquid, semisolid,
and deformable foods. Long-horizon refers to the goal of
“clearing the bowl” by sequentially acquiring the food from
the bowl. LAVA employs a hierarchical policy for long-horizon
food acquisition tasks. The framework uses high-level policy
to determine primitives by leveraging ScoopNet. At the mid-
level, LAVA finds parameters for primitives using vision. To
carry out sequential plans in the real world, LAVA delegates
action execution which is driven by Low-level policy that uses
parameters received from mid-level policy and behavior cloning
ensuring precise trajectory execution.
We validate our approach on complex real-world acquisition
trials involving granular, liquid, semisolid, and deformable food
types along with fruit chunks and soup acquisition. Across 46
bowls, LAVA acquires much more efficiently than baselines with
a success rate of 89 ± 4%, and generalizes across realistic plate
variations such as different positions, varieties, and amount of
food in the bowl.
